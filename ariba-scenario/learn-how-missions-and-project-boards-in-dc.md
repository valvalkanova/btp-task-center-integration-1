Missions include best practices and step-by-step guidance for implementing business use cases, with well-established support from the community and mission experts, free of cost.

Once you start a mission, you create your own instance of this mission. This allows you to adapt and customize the content according to your specific needs, to invite your team members to work on the whole mission or on specific steps, and to interact with the mission coaches directly. See [Getting Started with Discovery Center Missions](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/protected/index.html#/missiondetail/3918/3389/).

Every mission contains a project board that allows you to:

- Get an overview of all the potential deliverables for a mission, whether it is onboarding or implementation.
- View fully customizable tasks that are listed as cards and categorized into phases (columns).
We realize that each of your missions can be unique, this board supports that.
